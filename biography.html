                <h2>Manzoor Sakhirani</h2>
                <p>Manzoor Sakhirani’s real name is "Manzoor Ali". He was born on "April 14, 1959", in "District Dadu,
                    Sindh". He is one of the most popular and respected Sindhi singers who gave Sindhi music a new
                    identity and earned a special place in the hearts of his people.
                    <br>
                    His father, "Baharuddin", worked in the Revenue Department. He wanted his son to become an engineer,

            </div>
            <div class="bio-box">
                <h2>Fozia Somroo</h2>
                <p>Fozia Soomro’s real name was "Hakeema". She was born in "1966" in "Kharsar, Tharparkar", Sindh. She
                    came from a simple, religious, and culturally rich family. Her father, "Haji Nathoo Soomro", was a
                    "Maulood" and "Qawwali" singer who helped her recognize her natural talent and voice from childhood.
                    <br>
                    When Fozia was young, her family faced financial hardships. Because of this, they moved from
                    Tharparkar to "Tando Muhammad Khan", where she began a new chapter of her life.
                    <br>
                    From an early age, she had a strong passion for music. At that time, however, it was not considered
                    acceptable for girls to sing publicly. Despite these social restrictions, she began singing secretly
                    at women’s gatherings and small events. By the age of sixteen, she had already won people’s hearts
                    with her natural, emotional, and melodious voice.
                    <br>
                    Her true recognition came when "Naseer Mirza", a producer at "Radio Pakistan Hyderabad", heard her
                    sing. He recorded two songs with her, "Be Qadra Qadr Na Kayaee Ko" and "Chade Wai Chade Wai Sathi
                    Sukhan Ja". Both songs became extremely popular across Sindh, turning Fozia Soomro into a star
                    overnight.
                    <br>
                    Throughout her career, she sang in "Sindhi", "Thari", and "Marwari" languages. Her style was
                    powerful, emotional, and deeply connected to Sindhi folk music traditions. Her songs expressed the
                    pain, love, separation, and emotions of women.
                    <br>
                    She often performed at "Sufi" and cultural events. During the 1990s, her songs were played in every
                    cassette shop and on every radio station across Sindh. She released "over 50 albums and cassettes",
                    and her voice reached both urban and rural areas.
                    <br>
                    Some of her most famous songs include:
                    <br>
                    * Be Qadra Qadr Na Kayaee Ko <br>
                    * Chade Wai Chade Wai Sathi Sukhan Ja <br>
                    * To Kehri Ibaadat Aa Jo Manjho Dil Na Mane <br>
                    * Mitho Maro Mohan <br>
                    * Na Ja Dilber Na Ja <br>
                    * Suhni Saheli <br>
                    <br>
                    Fozia Soomro gave Sindhi folk music a new identity. At a time when the Sindhi music industry was
                    dominated by male singers, she used her voice to open the door for women. Her songs spread to every
                    corner of Sindh, especially in "Tharparkar" and "Badin" regions.
                    <br>
                    During her career, she received the "Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai Award" and several other regional
                    honors. For the people of Sindh, her music was more than just entertainment. It became a symbol of
                    Sindhi identity and culture.
                    <br>
                    Fozia Soomro’s life was short, but her art lived long. She passed away on "4 September 2002" due to
                    "kidney failure" at the age of only "36". After her death, the people of Sindh and local media gave
                    her the title "Bemisaal Thari Rani" (The Unmatched Queen of Thar).
                    <br>
                    Even today, her songs are played on radio, YouTube, and at cultural gatherings. Her voice carries
                    the essence of Sindh—its deserts, traditions, and spirit. She gave Sindhi and Marwari music a unique
                    identity and earned a permanent place in the hearts of Sindhi people.
                    <br>
                    Her name still stands among the legends of Sindhi music, and her voice remains one of the most
                    beautiful memories of Sindh.

                <p>Sarmad Sindhi’s real name was “Abdul Rehman Mughal”. He was born on “7 July 1961” in “Piryaloi,
                    Khairpur District, Sindh, Pakistan”. He emerged as a folk singer who used the Sindhi language and is
                    considered one of the notable voices of the golden era of Sindhi literature and music.
                    <br>
                    Sarmad Sindhi began his musical career around the year “1978” and remained active until his untimely
                    death in “1996”. His songs covered a wide range of folk styles, and he also used his lyrics to speak
                    about the issues of the people of Sindh—for example the line “Sindh uchi aa, Sindhi uchi aa” (“Sindh
                    is high, Sindhi is high”).
                    <br>
                    Among his most popular songs were “Tuhiji Yaad Ji Wari Aa Weer” and “Piyar Manjharan Pengho Loday
                    Loli Diyan”, which became generational anthems across Sindh.

                    his songs and social work.
                    <br>
                    Today, Sarmad Sindhi is still remembered not only as a great singer but as someone whose voice
                    expressed the culture, struggles and pride of Sindh.
